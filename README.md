I. To find all 9 letter words in the English language for which for each one word of
decision, the following is true:
- it is possible to remove one letter from the word and get a valid 8 letter word;
- one letter can be removed from the 8-letter word and a valid 7-letter word can be obtained;
- from the 7-letter word one letter can be removed and a valid 6-letter word is obtained and
etc., until a one-letter valid word is obtained;
- valid single letter words are "I" and "A"
You can see an example of the word "STARTLING" from here: https://www.republicworld.com/whatsappquizzes-and-puzzles/riddles/what-9-letter-word-is-still-a-word-after-removing- one-letter-each-time.html
Summary: to find all valid 9 letter words that can be led to
single letters, by stepwise removal of one letter, and after each removal we will get
again a valid word.
II. The task must be optimized for speed. If a word is valid in one combination
from removing letters, there is no need to check whether it would be valid if we removed
other letters.
